## 🤔 What is this?

**Awesome Financial Freedom** is an open-source, AI-native FIRE planning system for Chinese investors. It combines structured knowledge, deterministic calculators, and a stage-based UX so a financial beginner knows exactly what to do today — not just what the math says in 20 years.

Core components:

- 🎯 **5-question stage diagnosis** — detects your current FIRE stage (debt phase → emergency fund → investing → accelerating → optimizing → sprinting) in under 30 seconds
- 🛠️ **6 stage-specific tools** — debt avalanche/snowball calculator, emergency fund progress bar, DCA simulator, savings-rate sensitivity table, rebalancing checklist, Coast FIRE calculator
- 📊 **Extended FIRE calculator** — income growth simulation, side-income scenarios, retirement lifestyle comparison (city / smaller city / Southeast Asia arbitrage / minimal), Coast FIRE check
- 🏦 **China-specific** — 综合所得税档 + 专项附加扣除 → "税后真实储蓄率"; 个人养老金 (¥12,000/yr tax deduction); 公积金 optimization; A-share/QDII/Gold ETF codes (510300/513500/518880)
- 📊 **Multi-scenario comparator** — save 2–4 scenarios (e.g. "现状 / 加薪 10% / 副业 3k / 搬清迈") and see FIRE-age delta side-by-side
- 💾 **Monthly snapshot tracking** — localStorage snapshots, sparkline chart, trend arrows, **CSV / JSON export**, no backend
- 🤖 **One-click AI analysis (BYOK)** — paste your own Anthropic API key (stored locally), streams Claude analysis directly in the browser; or copy a structured 8-section prompt for any LLM
- 🧠 **28 JSON knowledge nodes** — visible in-UI knowledge card, structured for accurate AI consumption
- 🤖 **One-click AI report** — structured 8-section prompt for Claude/ChatGPT, covers all new fields

## 🎯 Target audience

- People who want a direct path to financial freedom and actionable steps
- Young professionals who want to save but do not know where to start
- People who have heard of FIRE but do not know how it is calculated
- People who want AI to help plan their finances
- People who want to turn financial strategy into practical action

## ✨ Why This Exists

The internet is full of personal finance blogs, paid courses, and scattered advice. But there is **no open-source, structured, AI-ready financial freedom execution system** dedicated to helping people turn plans into action.

This project fills that gap by providing a **community-driven, transparent, and executable AI planning system**. Its core innovation lies in combining structured workflows, prompt templates, and calculator logic into a usable execution engine.
